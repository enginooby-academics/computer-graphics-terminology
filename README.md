### Motion vector
> Capture _**per-pixel, screen-space motion**_ of an object from _**previous to current frame**_  
+ 🛠 TAA - Motion blur

# Post Processing

### Fast approximate anti-aliasing {FXAA}
> _**👍 Fastest, 👎 low-quality**_ AA method, doesn't require ~~_**[motion vector](#motion-vector)**_~~
+ 🛠 _**Mobile**_ devices, _**low-end PCs**_, platforms don't support motion vector

### Subpixel morphological anti-aliasing {SMAA}
> _**👎 Slower, 👍 high-quality**_ AA method, doesn't require ~~_**[motion vector](#motion-vector)**_~~. 
+ 👎 Not compatible with ~~_**mobile devices & XR**_~~
